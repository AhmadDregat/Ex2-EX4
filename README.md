OOP_EX2-Ex4
This Github project is an educational example for using git & github as part of the Object Oriented Programming course in Ariel University. The main focus of this project is to allow an online suppoer of Ex2, Ex3, Ex4 which are all related to a GIS like system.

#Project this was the first stage of developing this project, we will contenue developing the project for 2 more stages.

#Project Overview This is a Geographic Information System (GIS), we convert a Csv file into a kml file the csv file contains a list of wifi points with their information first we identified the elements of the gps point,added the right functions for Coords package then we wrote the kml/csv/multiCsv classes after reading the csv file and making it a kml file, we can uplode the file on apps such as google earth and see these gps points
